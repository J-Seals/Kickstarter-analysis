# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Findings
By dissecting the data and comparing Parent Categories, we see that the category Theater had a much higher outcome rate compared to other categories.

Within the Theater Category, a little more than half of the outcomes were successful. Meaning that, those that were successful met their goal.

Now we will discuss how outcomes are effected by time of the year.

By looking at our graph, we can see that May has the highest success rate, followed by June and July. This tells us that campaigns that start in these months are more likely to be successful by reaching their goal.
